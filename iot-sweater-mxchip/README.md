This project is based on [Quickstart: Add IoT Plug and Play to your MXChip IoT DevKit](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mxchip-iot-devkit-pnp) with slight modifications to enable connecting to Azure IoT Central using Device Provisioning Service (DPS).  All the trouble shooting and setup instructions in the [original readme document](QuickStartREADME.md) apply.
