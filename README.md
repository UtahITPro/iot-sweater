*Inspired by: Jim Bennett's [iot ugly sweater project](https://github.com/jimbobbennett/IoTUglySweater ) which is a python implementation of this.*
  
There are two parts for this project:
1. Use **[the instructions in the iot-central folder](iot-central/README.md)** 
to Setup and configure an [Azure IoT Central](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-central/) instance.


2. Configure your device to connect to your instance of Azure IoT Central.  There are two options for this:
    1. You can use an [ESP-32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) development board and C# using [.NET Nano Framework](https://www.nanoframework.net/) 
    for instructions on how to do this refer to documentation in the **[iot-sweater-nf folder](iot-sweater-nf/README.md)**
    1. You can also use [MXCHIP AZ3166 IOT Developer Kit](https://www.seeedstudio.com/AZ3166-IOT-Developer-Kit.html) using *C* 
    for instructions on how to do this refer to documentation in the **[iot-sweater-mxchip](iot-sweater-mxchip/README.md)** 
    for more information about the iot devkit you can look at the [MXCHIP AZ3166 devkit Quick Start](https://aka.ms/iot-devkit)
